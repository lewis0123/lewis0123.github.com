**IT LESSON 1**

This lesson was all about adverts media with, how it can be performed, what are the messages it is trying to give us and how and who to trust.

	One of the main the big things in media is how to trust it. Mr Keen gave is a bingo sheet and what we had to do was find someone in the class that could do that thing e.g. access to internet whenever they want or they can speak another language other than english.  But really he knew that get forced into doing it by the person that was trying to tick it off or  a lot of us would lie, which also tied into peer pressure. 

	Next we looked at different types of media for example, text, email, letter, social. Also advertisements e.g. newspaper, tv, radio, billboard.

	Then we looked at a funky television ad for Kia.  It was about three very unfit hamsters making their journey to the top.  We found out that Kia were trying to say that it is better than the last one and also that life is better when you are famous and skinny.
