IT LESSON 4

The homework for lesson 4 was to create an identity map. In the lesson we had to go around writing positive and negative comments. Creating my identity map was very fun, because I got to set it out in an creative way. I enjoyed this, because I could set it out MY way. I felt quite confident sharing my map, because I felt that it showed me as a person and no one can change that. commenting on the maps was fine, because we didn't say who wrote what. Having this kind of approach to the lesson gave me a lot of confidence. I think this was the best way to approach the lesson, because people wouldn't feel isolated or scared to write something negative. Reading the comments on my identity map, I felt pretty happy and there were no surprises, everything was obvious. This project did not change my thoughts of posting more,(or less),and it did not change my plan of using social media, personally I think I post the right amount and use my social media sensibly.
