IT lesson June 30

This lesson had a bit more going on, compared to the last few lessons. Finally our microbits arrived and we had a little go with them for the first 15 minutes of the lesson. Then we had a talk about what dangers we need to look out for and not get involved in, on the internet and a lot of these were sexual reasons. Some of them were groomers, paedophiles, porn, sexting and revenge porn. And with those last two you can have a look at some news articles about them; [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36054273](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36054273) and [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24539514](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24539514) .
