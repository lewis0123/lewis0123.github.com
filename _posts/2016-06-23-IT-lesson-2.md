**IT lesson 2**

In this lesson we learnt about fake advertising and how companies make their products look better.  We also saw a mcdonalds advert about how they are admitting that they change the look of their advertising burgers to their normal burgers.

We also did an experiment about social media to see what people felt about different situations and there was a big variation between different people.
