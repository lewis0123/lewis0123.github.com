**Nike football: the last game**

	This is a very good commercial that really inspires you to take risks, to try your hardest and never give up.  It is also showing that if you have something that is getting in your way or destroying you then don't ignore it, challenge it.

	Nike have also been extremely clever by choosing to but their story of an advert on at the time of the Brazilian football world cup, actually between half-time and before and after the games.  It is an extremely profound thing to show to any football fan or anyone in the world, which is really how it was really key for them to put their advert on at that specific time.
